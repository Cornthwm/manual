# (PART\*) Publishing Data
# Data publication and sharing

OBIS nodes can accept any data files from its data sources or data providers, and they publish these data on their OBIS nodes IPT, which are harvested by central OBIS. The Integrated Publishing Toolkit (IPT) is developed and maintained by the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF). GBIF maintains an [IPT manual](https://github.com/gbif/ipt/wiki/IPT2ManualNotes.wiki). See here for specific OBIS instructions:
  

## Add metadata

Metadata enables users to discover, assess, understand and attribute your dataset for their particular needs, so it pays off to invest some time providing them.

Go to your resource overview page > Metadata and click Edit to open the metadata editor. Any information you provide here will be visible on the resource homepage and bundled together with your data when you publish.

Follow the [OBIS metadata standards and best practices](../eml), or check the [IPT manual](https://github.com/gbif/ipt/wiki/IPT2ManualNotes.wiki#metadata) for detailed instructions about the metadata editor.
