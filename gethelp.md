## Getting Help in OBIS

If you require additional assistance with OBIS we recommend you first get in touch with the most [relevant OBIS node](https://obis.org/contact/). We also have a **support channel** on [Slack](https://obishq.slack.com/archives/C014PTTKECW) where you can communicate with the OBIS community for help. Please feel comfortable posting to this channel before reaching out to the OBIS Secretariat (helpdesk@obis.org). The OBIS community is quite active on Slack so you are more likely to receive a quick answer to your question by posting there, as the Secretariat receives many requests.

Finally, you can submit an issue on relevant Github repositories:

* [OBIS Manual](https://github.com/iobis/manual/issues)
* [OBIS Website](https://github.com/iobis/web)
* [All other OBIS repositories](https://github.com/iobis)
