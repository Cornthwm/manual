## OBIS Data Life Cycle

The basic data life cycle for contributions to OBIS can be broken down into six step-by-step phases:

1. Data structure
2. Data formatting
3. Quality control
4. Publishing
5. Data access (downloading)
6. Data visualization

## Biodiversity data standards

From the very beginning, OBIS has championed the use of international standards for biogeographic data. Without agreement on the application of standards and protocols, OBIS would not have been able to build a large central database. OBIS uses the following standards:

* [Darwin Core](darwin_core.html)
* [Ecological Metadata Language](eml.html)
* [Darwin Core Archive and dataset structure](data_format.html)

The following pages of this manual review each of these in turn. We show you how to apply these standards to format your data in the [Data Formatting](formatting.html) section.

We also provide some [dataset examples](examples.html) for your reference.
